# Inventory Management System - Backend

## Description
The Inventory Management System Backend is the server-side component of the Inventory Management System project, built with Nest.js and Prisma. It provides RESTful APIs for managing inventory data, including Suppliers, Orders, Sales, and Products. This backend system ensures secure data storage and manipulation, allowing the [frontend](https://github.com/danielreboucas/inventory-management-frontend) application to interact seamlessly with the inventory database.

## Features
- RESTful APIs: Implements RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on inventory data entities, including Suppliers, Orders, Sales, and Products.
- Database Integration: Utilizes Prisma ORM for database interaction, ensuring efficient and type-safe communication with the underlying database.
- Authentication: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints and ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive data.
- Validation and Error Handling: Implements robust validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages to clients.
- Testing: (TODO) Implements unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend APIs.

## Technologies Used
- Nest.js: Back-end framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications, providing a robust foundation for developing RESTful APIs.
- Prisma: Modern database ORM and query builder for Node.js, enabling seamless communication with various databases and ensuring type-safe database interactions.
- TypeScript: Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, enhancing code quality, and developer productivity.
- Postman: API testing tool used to test the functionality and behavior of RESTful APIs, ensuring that they meet the specified requirements and behave as expected.
